Running the models for BNR:

Control is set up just like the quantile loadings. Inside each quantile:
	hydro: a 1-year hydro run.
		Needs linking to the correct ssm_riv.dat
	hydro_10yr: created from hydro outputs, see below
	spinup [control only]: A 10-year WQM run with no outputs but a 3650-day restart output. Uses default point source concentration profile
		Needs linking to the correct ssm_pnt_wq.dat
		Needs edits to wqm_linkage.in to point to a 10-year hydro run
	spinup_[x]: A 10-year WQM run with a uniform point source concentration profile adding up to x mg/L TN
	wqm [control only]: A 1-year WQM run using the 3650-day initial condition
		Needs linking to the correct ssm_pnt_wq.dat
		Needs a copy of the generated ssm_initial_wq_hotstart_3650.dat
		Needs edits to wqm_linkage.in to point to hydro
	wqm_[x]: A 1-year WQM run using the 3650-day initial condition and with a uniform point source concentration adding up to x mg/L TN

Procedure for running:
klone bnr/q0.x/hydro$ ssm_hyak.py hydro
[after hydro is finished]
ondra bnr$ ./hydro_1to10.py q0.x/hydro/OUTPUT/netcdf q0.x/hydro_10yr/OUTPUT/netcdf
klone bnr/q0.x/spinup_y$ ssm_hyak.py wqm
[after spinup is finished]
ondra bnr/q0.x/spinup_y/outputs$ make_ic_from_restart_newSedim_pH
	Restart file: restart.3650
	No changes
	Destination: ssm_initial_wq_hotstart_3650.dat
ondra bnr/q0.x$ cp -a spinup_y/outputs/ssm_initial_wq_hotstart_3650.dat wqm_y/inputs/
[rsync change to klone]
klone bnr/q0.x/wqm_y/outputs$ ssm_hyak.py wqm
